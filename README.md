## Installation Instructions (Normal installation):
### Step 1:
Download the OSDM:CM pack by clikcing on the "Code" button and clicking on "Download ZIP". You can locate the ZIP anywhere you can easily get access to the file.
### Step 2:
Once the file is downloaded, open it and double-click on the "OSDM-CustomMedia-main" folder. Next, open your file explorer application and locate the OldSkool DemoMaker program folder.
### Step 3:
In the program folder, make a new one and rename it to anything you want (Or just by typing the name of the project), and once the folder is created, open it and drag and drop the contents of the ZIP (CM_Anim, CM_Copper, CM_Fonts, etc...). But for this occasion, be sure to skip the "OSDM_bin" folder.
## Installation Instructions (Portable OSDM Installation):
### Step 1:
Download the OSDM:CM pack by clikcing on the "Code" button and clicking on "Download ZIP". You can locate the ZIP anywhere you can easily get access to the file.
### Step 2:
Once the file is downloaded, open it and double-click on the "OSDM-CustomMedia-main" folder. Next, open your file explorer application and locate a place to put the "OSDM_bin" folder (Like a folder that you usually save your portable programs, or anything but a easy place to locate the program). Once you select a place, drag and drop the "OSDM_bin" folder.
### Step 3:
In the "OSDM_bin" folder, make a new one and rename it to anything you want (Or just by typing the name of the project), and once the folder is created, open it and drag and drop the contents of the ZIP (CM_Anim, CM_Copper, CM_Fonts, etc...).
